PennMed Bookmarklet
===================

This is a bookmarklet that you can use with the Virtual Curriculum system. 
It lets you watch the lectures without using Silverlight, so you don't have to install any plugins and you can watch at 1.5x or 2x speed. 
Works on Windows, Mac, and Linux.

Usage
-----

Drag the link below to your bookmarks bar:

<a href="javascript:(function()%7Bs=document.createElement('script');s.type='text/javascript';s.src='https://raw.github.com/lyoshenka/pennmed/master/pennmed.min.js';document.body.appendChild(s);%7D)();">pennmed bookmarklet</a>

<a href="javascript:alert('hey')">hey</a>

When you open a video in VC2000, click the bookmark.
